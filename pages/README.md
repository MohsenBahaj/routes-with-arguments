# Flutter Navigation Project

## Overview

This Flutter project demonstrates a simple navigation setup between multiple pages in a Flutter application. It includes three pages: Home, Second, and Third. The project shows how to pass data between pages and navigate back to previous pages using Flutter's navigation system.

## File Structure

- `main.dart`: Entry point of the application.
- `Student.dart`: Defines the `Student` class used for passing data between pages.
- `pages/`
  - `page1.dart`: Contains the `Home` page.
  - `page2.dart`: Contains the `Second` page.
  - `page3.dart`: Contains the `Third` page.

## Pages

### Home Page

The `Home` page is the entry point of the application. It contains two buttons to navigate to the `Second` and `Third` pages, respectively.
